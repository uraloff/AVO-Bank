# AVO Bank

Hello, World!  This is my first serious project for <a href='https://avo.uz/ru?utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand_web_Poisk_21046021866&utm_group=162171001871&utm_content=aid_691878623679&utm_term=avo%20bank&placement=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwmrqzBhAoEiwAXVpgophR8hKeStnaFfiwuLagyeJeARAg7UVe25yf85qh7i96IrQmUkurgRoCVgoQAvD_BwE'>**AVO Bank**</a>. This project uses the **Aiogram** framework, the latest version of which. The development of this bot took a little more than 3-4 months. It could have been faster, but due to family and personal circumstances, I had to finish this project for so long. And the time spent learning this framework, and in general, the language itself, took so much time.

Previously, the bank had its own telegram bot, but it was so terrible to use. For example, when you click on the `/start` button, the bot will give out information so **casually** that you want to block this bot. Okay, let it be unclear, but after two or three clicks, he stupidly stops responding to the callback data. To remedy this situation, I decided, **without initial approval**, to develop a telegram bot for their company

#### What has been achieved:
- [X] Interactivity
- [X] The speed of responses to callback data
- [X] Multilingualism (in this case, two languages - Uzbek and Russian)
- [X] Clarity 

#### What has not been achieved:
- [ ] The ability to reach the support team 
- [ ] A variety of banking features have not been added, such as the ability to view the balance on a card, to check the history of transactions, to transfer funds from one card to another, and to add a new card
- [ ] Statistics for administrators

In this code, I have attempted to adhere to the principles of **"clean code"** to the best of my ability. While I am certain that I may have made some errors, this is only the beginning of my learning process. I have included comments in the button handlers in order to make the code easier to read, as there are numerous buttons present

I'd really appreciate some tips on how to improve this bot. I wanna learn some new tricks!
